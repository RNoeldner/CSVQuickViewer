Contributing
First off, thank you for considering contributing.

Where do I go from here?
If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

If you have a general question, you can post it in the the issue tracker.

Fork & create a branch
If this is something you think you can fix, then forkCSV Quick Viewer and create a branch with a descriptive name.
